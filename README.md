# Chip's Challenge

Welcome to a MATRIX edition of Chip's Challenge. This is a 2D tile based game inspired by the Atari video game. 

This version only includes two levels, but is very similar to the original game, with a Matrix-themed twist.

## Running the Game

Please download the jar file and open the files in a Java 8 IDE.


Press the small green 'play' button next to the main(String[] args) method in the Game class to begin the game.

## Usage

Use the arrow keys to navigate through the game. 

You must collect the transistor chips in order to pass the level, but you must collect the keys to open the doors in order to access rooms that have the remaining chips.

In order to restart the game or level, navigate the options in the toolbar at the top of the window.

Push the boxes wisely in order to pave the rest of the path to complete the level. 

You must also push the boxes onto the weight-pads in order to open the rest of the path. Make your choices wisely- otherwise, you may have to restart the level.

You are also being timed, so don't muck about too much!
