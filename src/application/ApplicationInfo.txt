The application package. This is responsible for managing the functionality of the game
(e.g. starting new games, loading/saving games, moving the player, managing the application window(s), etc).

The application should provide a Graphical User Interface through which the player can see the maze and interact with it through the following key strokes:

CTRL-X  - exit the game, the current game state will be lost, the next time the game is started, it will resume from the last unfinished level
CTRL-S  - exit the game, saves the game state, game will resume next time the application will be started
CTRL-R  - resume a saved game
CTRL-P  - start a new game at the last unfinished level
CTRL-1 - start a new game at level 1
SPACE - pause the game and display a �game is paused� dialog
ESC - close the �game is paused� dialog and resume the game
UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT ARROWS -- move Chap within the maze

The application window should display the time left to play, the current level, and the number of treasures that
 still need to be collected.  It should also offer buttons and menu items to pause and exit the game, to save 
the game state and to resume a saved game, and to display a help page with game rules. 

Note that the drawing of the actual maze is not the responsibility of the application component, but of the rendering component.

The application package must include an executable class nz.ac.vuw.ecs.swen225.a3.application.Main which starts the game.
