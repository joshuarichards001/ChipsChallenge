The maze package. This is responsible for maintaining the current state of the game, such as where the objects
 in the game currently are, and also for determining what actions are allowed within the game.

The game has levels, each level has a unique maze. Level 1 should have all the tiles listed in the table above,
and at least two different types (colours) of keys. Develop and use a creative custom look and feel (in particular,
 use your own icons).  Keep it simple so that the level can be easily played and finished within one minute. You 
should also implement a second level with some different tiles. The original Chip's Challenge game will provide 
some ideas, but you should invent your own tiles (see below). You should also use a second type of actor in level
 2 -- an actor is a game character that moves around, like Chap, and interacts with Chap (for instance, by
 exploding and eating Chap or robbing him). Unlike Chap, actors will move around on their own, and are not
 directed by user input. 
 
The maze package is responsible for maintaining the game state and implementing the game logic. The game state is
 primarily made up of the maze itself, the current location of Chap on the maze, the treasure chest and other items
 Chap has collected, such as keys. The game logic controls what events may, or may not happen in the game world 
(e.g. �Can Chap go through this door?�, �Can Chap pick up this object?�, �Does this key open that door?�, etc.)

The core logic of the game is that the player moves Chap around the maze until he reaches the exit and
advances to the next level (if there is another level). Levels have a timeout, if the timeout is reached 
before Chap reaches the exit, the level stops, and the player gets the option to restart the game at the 
current level.
