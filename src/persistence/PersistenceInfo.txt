The persistence package. This is responsible for reading map files and reading/writing files representing the
 current game state (in JSON format).

The persistence module saves the game state: the time left, and the position of Chap and other actors (if there 
are any), the treasures he holds, etc. Game state should be saved using the JSON format. Ensure (by means of 
testing or inspection) that the JSON format used is valid.
