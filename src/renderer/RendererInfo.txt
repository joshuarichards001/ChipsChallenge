The renderer package. This is responsible for drawing the maze onto a canvas and mapping key strokes on the canvas
 back to objects in the game world, etc.

The rendering window is responsible for providing a simple 2-dimensional view of the maze, updated after each
move in order to display the current game play. If you use �actors� that move around freely (like bugs trying 
to eat Chap), then the renderer needs to update the maze view more often. Rendering should ensure that the movement
 of the game board looks smooth. For larger boards, only a certain focus region of the board should be displayed,
 check the original Chip's Challenge game for an idea about the size of this focus area.
